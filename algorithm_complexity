// Time Complexity = The time Complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of
// steps to finish the execution.

// Space Complexity =
// * space Complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
// * space Complexity = Auxiliary space + input size.

// Big O notation : Use to denote Complexity(both)


// O(1) > O(logN) > O(n) > O(nlogN) > O(n^2)
